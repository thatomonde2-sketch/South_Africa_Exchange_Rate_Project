Clean and restructure historical exchange rate data



Perform descriptive statistical analysis



Estimate a trend regression model



Forecast future exchange rate values



Visualize historical trends and forecasts



Document findings in a research-style report



&nbsp;Tools and Technologies



Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)



Microsoft Excel



Git and GitHub



Econometrics and time series analysis
